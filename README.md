# Exploratory Analysis and Price Prediction of Beijing Housing

This class project is designed for us to become productive with the application of our new data science skills into real-life working. Data used for the alternative class project is related to housing prices in Califonia and this is then interesting to take a look at the housing prices in my home country, China since the housing market in China has bloomed for these years. The variation between the home's prices is quite huge among different regions and years. I found one dataset on [Kaggle.com] which contains housing prices of Beijing from 2011 to 2017, fetching from [Lianjia.com] and it contains over 300 thousand transaction records by Lianjia, one of the biggest Chinese real-estate brokerage company founded in 2001. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to predict the housing price values in Beijing.
